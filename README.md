My first and Basic Website
I worked on a web development project where I created a Background Image Changer website. This project, my first in web development, involved learning and utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I designed a responsive interface and implemented JavaScript functionalities to allow users to dynamically change the background image. This experience not only solidified my understanding of web technologies but also enhanced my skills in creating interactive and user-friendly web applications.
